# How to Download and Set up the development environment in Android Studio
The dhis2-android-sdk project https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-android-sdk folder should be in a subfolder named sdk inside dhis2-android-eventcapture. It is configured as a git submodule, so it will be automatically included when cloned using --recursive. 
 
Currently, the compatibility is guaranteed with 2.27, 2.28 and 2.29 servers, use develop branch in dhis2-android-eventcapture and event-capture branch in dhis2-android-sdk repositories.
 
When cloning from zero, it's strongly recommended to do it as follows:
 
```
git clone --recursive -b develop git@github.com:dhis2/dhis2-android-eventcapture.git
cd dhis2-android-eventcapture/sdk
git checkout event-capture
```
 
Then open Android Studio, select "File" -> "Open", and select the build.gradle in dhis2-android-eventcapture/
